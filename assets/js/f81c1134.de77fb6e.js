They enable writers and designers to craft interactive conversations that shape the player\u2019s journey, enhancing immersion and narrative depth. With story-driven games gaining popularity across genres, the right **branching dialogue tool** can be the difference between a flat experience and a captivating one.\\n\\nIn this article, we will explore why **branching dialogue tools** are critical, the features you should look for, and how **[Drafft](https://drafft.dev/)** provides a powerful solution tailored for indie developers and studios.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Is a Branching Dialogue Tool?\\n\\nA **branching dialogue tool** is specialized software that allows developers to design and manage non-linear conversations for games. Unlike traditional linear scripts, branching dialogue creates multiple paths that adapt based on player choices, game states, or conditions.\\n\\nThis approach gives players:\\n\\n- **Agency**: The ability to influence the story.\\n- **Replay value**: Multiple playthroughs reveal new outcomes.\\n- **Immersion**: Characters respond dynamically to player actions.\\n\\nBy leveraging a robust **branching dialogue tool**, developers streamline narrative complexity while maintaining control over story logic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why Use a Branching Dialogue Tool Instead of Spreadsheets or Text Files?\\n\\nWhile some teams start with spreadsheets or raw text files, these approaches quickly become unmanageable. A dedicated **branching dialogue tool** offers:\\n\\n- **Visual clarity**: See dialogue trees and branching paths at a glance.\\n- **Error reduction**: Tools validate connections and detect missing links.\\n- **Collaboration**: Writers, designers, and developers work in sync.\\n- **Export flexibility**: Structured outputs (JSON, YAML, etc.) integrate with game engines.\\n\\nWithout these capabilities, projects risk becoming bogged down in complexity, leading to bugs and inconsistent narrative flows.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Features to Look For in a Branching Dialogue Tool\\n\\nWhen evaluating a **branching dialogue tool**, consider the following must-have features:\\n\\n### 1. Visual Node-Based Editing\\n\\nA drag-and-drop node editor makes it easy to design branching dialogue without digging through text files. Visual flowcharts reveal how conversations evolve.\\n\\n### 2. Conditional Logic Support\\n\\nBranching dialogue often depends on variables\u2014such as player stats, quest progress, or past choices. A strong tool allows you to set conditions directly within the dialogue flow.\\n\\n### 3. Multi-Format Export\\n\\nGames rely on structured formats like **JSON, HJSON, TOML, or YAML**. The best tools provide seamless exports so dialogue integrates with your engine.\\n\\n### 4. Collaboration Features\\n\\nGame narratives are rarely built by one person. Look for a **branching dialogue tool** that enables teams to edit, review, and refine together.\\n\\n### 5. Cross-Document Integration\\n\\nDialogue rarely exists in isolation. A great tool links conversations to **quests, items, and character data**, ensuring narrative consistency across systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Benefits of Using a Branching Dialogue Tool\\n\\nA professional **branching dialogue tool** delivers clear advantages:\\n\\n- **Efficiency**: Rapidly design and test dialogue trees.\\n- **Scalability**: Handle hundreds of branching paths without chaos.\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure character voices and story arcs align.\\n- **Reduced bugs**: Avoid broken links and missing conditions.\\n\\nFor indie developers, these benefits save critical time and resources while keeping the creative process enjoyable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Drafft: The Modern Branching Dialogue Tool for Indie Developers\\n\\nAt **Drafft**, we built a **branching dialogue tool** designed to meet the real needs of game creators. Unlike generic text editors or rigid schema-based systems, Drafft strikes the perfect balance between flexibility and structure.\\n\\n### Why Drafft Stands Out\\n\\n- **Simple node-based editor**: Easily design dialogue trees with a clean, intuitive interface.\\n- **Condition and property management**: Set conditions for choices without hardcoding logic.\\n- **Unified ecosystem**: Drafft isn\u2019t just a branching dialogue tool\u2014it connects dialogue with **quests, items, and grid-based systems** for complete game design workflows.\\n- **Standard JSON export**: Drafft delivers exports in standard JSON format, ready for your engine.\\n\\nBy focusing on developer freedom, Drafft empowers creators to **own their data** and keep control of their game\u2019s narrative assets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Get Started with Drafft.dev\\n\\n1.

Manually formatting dialogue scripts. Syncing dozens of files between designers and devs. These tasks don\u2019t get much attention, but they quietly slow down development and introduce a mountain of human error.\\n\\nAt Drafft, we think there\u2019s a better way.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Quiet Chaos of Game Data\\n\\nMost teams manage game content across a patchwork of tools: spreadsheets for item stats, text files for dialogue, Google Docs for lore, and maybe a Trello board or Notion page for organizing it all.\\n\\nThat\u2019s fine when the project is small. But once the game grows, these tools start working against you:\\n\\n- Dialogue doesn\u2019t match what\'s in the build.\\n- Quest data lives in eight different places.\\n- Designers can\u2019t tweak values without asking a programmer to \u201cre-import\u201d it.\\n\\nThe root of the problem? Game data isn\'t just code. It\u2019s a living part of your design process\u2014and it needs an interface that reflects that.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Drafft: A Better Way to Manage Game Data\\n\\nDrafft was built to reduce that chaos. It gives your team a **central hub for all your game data**, with tools designed specifically for the types of content you work with:\\n\\n### \ud83e\udded Game Design Documents\\n\\nWrite, link, and organize full GDDs using a powerful markdown editor. Embed images, videos, and even task checklists. Export to PDF when you need a shareable version.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcac Dialogue & Script Editor\\n\\nDesign branching conversations visually with a non-linear graph editor. Each node connects to a script line, complete with speaker tags, stage directions, and VO cues. Export dialogue as formatted screenplay or structured JSON.\\n\\n### \ud83e\uddf1 Items & Object Editors\\n\\nDefine items using custom fields like name, type, description, effects, and more. Create schemas on the fly and fill them out using a human friendly language. Great for inventories, characters, or any structured object.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfaf Quests with Conditions\\n\\nUse a dual-pane editor to describe quest metadata (title, rewards, etc.) and the conditions required for completion. Supports nested logic, game state flags, and JSON/YAML/TOML formats.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcca Grid-Based Tables\\n\\nSometimes you just want a spreadsheet\u2014and Drafft has that too. Create table schemas and enter data in rows and columns. Perfect for stat blocks, level setups, enemy waves, and more.\\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Kanban for Tasks & Notes\\n\\nOrganize your ideas, bugs, or worldbuilding notes with drag-and-drop Kanban boards. Each card supports markdown and links to related documents in your project.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Clean Exports, Ready for Game Engines\\n\\nAll Drafft content exports as structured JSON. That means you can use it with **any game engine**, not just one we picked for you.\\n\\nWant to load dialogue into Godot? Use our community importer. Need quest data in Unity? Write a small parser. Drafft gives you the raw materials\u2014you plug them into your engine.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Local-First. Team-Friendly.\\n\\nYour project is stored locally using PouchDB, which means:\\n\\n- **No internet required** to work.\\n- **Full control over your data** (host it yourself).\\n- **Real-time sync** between collaborators on the same DB via a CouchDB server.\\n\\nYou get the benefits of cloud sync without the risks of lock-in or slow performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary: Game Data Deserves Better Tools\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Drafft is not a fancy text editor or a glorified spreadsheet. It\'s a unified space for entering, editing, and shipping the content that makes your game playable.\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re scripting a story, balancing a skill tree, or outlining your entire GDD\u2014Drafft helps you stay organized and in sync, without touching raw files or reinventing your pipeline every time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n:::tip Ready to stop wrestling with spreadsheets?\\n[Try Drafft today\u2192](https://drafft.dev#pricing)\\n:::\\n\\n<div className=\\"bg-dark-background-darker-3 py-2 p-8 pb-8 rounded-lg\\">\\n  <GetStartedCTA showTitle={false} showDescription={true} showLearnMore={true} />\\n</div>"},{"id":"introducing-kanban-boards-in-drafft","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introducing-kanban-boards-in-drafft","editUrl":"https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-website/edit/main/blog/2025-05-12-kanban.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-12-kanban.mdx","title":"Introducing Kanban Boards in Drafft: Visual Workflow for Game Dev Projects","description":"Track your game development tasks with visual Kanban boards inside Drafft.

(And Why You Actually Need One)","permalink":"/blog/game-design-document-guide"}},"content":"import GetStartedCTA from \\"@site/src/components/cta/GetStartedCTA\\";\\n\\nIf you\'re an indie game developer, you know the thrill of bringing your vision to life is often tangled up with frustrating workflow headaches. You might spend hours battling clunky text editors, lose valuable time waiting for game engine recompiles, or struggle to keep track of scattered files and collaborate effectively. These problems can feel like they\'re fighting against your creative flow. But what if there was a tool designed to tackle these exact issues, offering a better way to manage your project and speed up development?\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n#### Common Headaches: The Symptoms of Disorganized Game Dev\\n\\nBefore finding a solution, it\'s crucial to recognize the problems plaguing many game development workflows, especially when dealing with narrative, scripts, and design data.\\n\\nOne major bottleneck is **slow iteration** tied to embedding scripts and dialogue directly within game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine. Every minor script change can require a full engine recompile, leading to minutes of waiting just to test a dialogue tweak. This creates brittle workflows where updating content means rebuilding the entire project, and code becomes tangled with content, making reuse difficult.\\n\\nFurthermore, **inadequate text editors** often found within game engines can feel like \\"Stone Age tools\\". They may lack essential features like syntax highlighting, search/replace across files, autocomplete, or error checking, making editing data formats like JSON incredibly frustrating.\\n\\nMoving content to **external files** solves the recompile issue and allows for version control, but it introduces a new nightmare: managing hundreds of scattered text or JSON files. Tedious formatting issues like missing commas can lead to hours of debugging. A folder of hundreds of files doesn\'t constitute an organized workflow. This scattered data also leads to **lost or misplaced design data** and significant **version control issues**, with developers risking overwriting critical information or using outdated files.\\n\\nOn top of data chaos, **collaboration becomes a nightmare** with scattered files. Git merges for dialogue trees, for instance, can be a shudder-inducing prospect. Existing, traditional tools like Articy:Draft might offer features but are often prohibitively expensive for indie teams, can be overkill, require subscriptions, and depend on the cloud, meaning you don\'t fully own your data.\\n\\nFinally, maintaining **coherence** across all interconnected elements \u2013 quests, items, story branches \u2013 becomes overwhelming when design data is disorganized.\\n\\n#### Drafft\'s Cure: Centralization & Efficiency\\n\\nDrafft was built specifically to address these game development headaches. It\'s a **multi-platform, offline-first, privacy-focused tool** designed to **centralize your game content**. It provides a **single source of truth** for your development process, ensuring everything is easily accessible and well-structured.\\n\\n- **Solving Data Chaos:** Drafft tackles scattered data by providing **centralized data management**. All your game assets, scripts, dialogue trees, notes, and documentation can be stored in **one place**, reducing confusion and redundancy. It organizes data in a **unified structure**, allowing you to search, sort, and edit like a database.

Whether you are a solo indie developer or part of a large studio, navigating the complexities of transforming an idea into a playable game demands a central point of reference. This is where the **Game Design Document**, commonly known as the **GDD**, becomes indispensable. It serves not merely as paperwork, but as the foundational blueprint that guides the entire development process.\\n\\nWe understand that the idea of writing a comprehensive document can seem daunting, particularly for creators eager to jump straight into prototyping. However, overlooking the importance of a **well-structured GDD** can lead to significant challenges down the line, including scope creep, misaligned team efforts, and ultimately, a failure to realize the game\'s full potential. In this guide, we delve deep into what a **GDD** is, why it is critical for projects of all sizes, common reasons why many fail, the essential components of an effective document, and how to ensure your **GDD** remains a living, valuable asset throughout your **game development** journey.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What is a Game Design Document (GDD)?\\n\\nAt its core, a **Game Design Document (GDD)** is a detailed, living blueprint that outlines every significant aspect of a game project. It is the central source of truth that describes the game\'s concept, **core mechanics**, storyline, characters, art style, audio direction, user interface, technical requirements, target audience, and production schedules. Think of it as the architectural plan before construction begins \u2013 it ensures everyone involved understands the vision, the scope, and their role in building the final product.\\n\\nUnlike a static proposal or a simple pitch document, a **GDD** is dynamic. It evolves alongside the game during its development lifecycle, reflecting changes, iterations, and new insights gained during prototyping, testing, and feedback loops. A well-maintained **GDD** serves multiple critical functions:\\n\\n- **Clarifies the Vision:** It articulates the game\'s core concept, unique selling proposition, and overall goals, ensuring a shared understanding among all stakeholders.\\n- **Guides Development:** It provides detailed specifications for designers, programmers, artists, sound engineers, and writers, helping them execute their tasks in alignment with the overarching design.\\n- **Manages Scope:** By detailing features and systems, the **GDD** helps define the project\'s boundaries, mitigating the risk of unmanaged feature creep that can derail timelines and budgets.\\n- **Facilitates Communication:** It acts as a central repository of information, reducing assumptions and misunderstandings within the team. It is particularly crucial for onboarding new team members.\\n- **Aids Decision Making:** When faced with design choices, the **GDD** provides a reference point to ensure decisions align with the game\'s fundamental principles and goals.\\n- **Supports Production Planning:** Details within the document inform task breakdown, scheduling, and resource allocation.\\n\\nEffectively, the **GDD** transforms abstract ideas into concrete requirements and shared understanding, making the daunting task of **game development** more manageable and focused.\\n\\n## Why a Game Design Document is Essential\\n\\nWhile some developers, particularly in very small teams or solo projects, might be tempted to skip or minimize the **GDD** process, doing so often proves to be a false economy. The benefits of creating and maintaining a **GDD** far outweigh the initial time investment. A robust **design document** is not merely a bureaucratic hurdle; it is a powerful tool for success.\\n\\nFirstly, a **GDD** is crucial for achieving **clarity and alignment**. Without a central document detailing the game\'s vision, mechanics, and content, team members can develop differing interpretations of what the game is supposed to be. This can lead to conflicting work, wasted effort, and ultimately, a disjointed final product. The **GDD** ensures everyone is literally and figuratively on the same page.\\n\\nSecondly, it is vital for **scope management**. **Game development** is notorious for its potential for scope creep \u2013 the uncontrolled addition of features beyond the original plan. A detailed **GDD** serves as a baseline, clearly defining what is _in_ the game and, implicitly, what is _out_. This allows teams to make informed decisions about potential additions and understand their impact on resources and timelines. For **indie game development**, where resources are often scarce, managing scope is paramount to actually shipping a game.\\n\\nThirdly, the **GDD** significantly **improves communication and collaboration**. It provides a structured way to document ideas, decisions, and specifications. Instead of relying on scattered emails, chat messages, or verbal agreements, team members can refer to the **GDD** for definitive information on **game mechanics**, story beats, art styles, and technical constraints. This is particularly beneficial for remote teams or projects involving external contractors.\\n\\nFurthermore, a comprehensive **GDD** is often a prerequisite when seeking **funding or pitching to publishers**. Investors and publishers want to see a clear, well-thought-out plan that demonstrates the viability and potential of your game concept. A professional **GDD** showcases your understanding of the project, its market, and the steps required to bring it to completion.\\n\\nFinally, the **GDD** serves as an invaluable **onboarding tool** for new team members. Instead of spending days or weeks explaining the project history, core concepts, and current status, new hires can study the **GDD** to quickly get up to speed on all aspects of the game.\\n\\nIn essence, the **Game Design Document** transforms a creative idea into a concrete plan of action. It is an essential tool for mitigating risks, ensuring consistency, fostering collaboration, and ultimately, increasing the probability of successfully completing and launching a compelling game.\\n\\n## Common Pitfalls: Why Many Game Design Documents Fail\\n\\nDespite the clear advantages, many **Game Design Documents** fall short of their potential, sometimes becoming burdensome artifacts rather than helpful tools. Understanding the common reasons for failure is key to creating a **GDD** that genuinely supports development.\\n\\nOne frequent issue is the **overly rigid and static nature** of the document. Traditionally, **GDDs** were conceived as massive, comprehensive documents written entirely before development began. This waterfall approach often fails in the iterative world of **game development**. Games evolve; mechanics change based on prototyping feedback, story elements are refined, and technical challenges necessitate design adjustments. A **GDD** that doesn\'t adapt quickly becomes outdated and irrelevant, losing the team\'s trust and usefulness.\\n\\nAnother significant pitfall is **excessive detail too early**. While thoroughness is important, documenting every minute detail of every potential system before the core **game mechanics** are even proven can be a massive waste of time. Designs often change dramatically during the initial stages of development. Over-detailing prematurely can lead to a bloated document that is difficult to maintain and discouraging to read. This is particularly challenging for **indie developers** with limited time and resources.\\n\\nThe **tools used** can also contribute to failure. Many teams resort to generic word processors or spreadsheets, which are not designed for the unique needs of a **game design document**. These tools often make collaboration difficult, version control messy, and linking related information (like a mechanic description to a specific UI element) cumbersome. This leads to fragmented documentation and a reluctance for the team to use or update the **GDD**.\\n\\nFurthermore, a lack of **team buy-in and ownership** can doom a **GDD**. If the document is seen as solely the responsibility of the lead designer or a single individual, and the rest of the team does not actively use or contribute to it, it quickly becomes neglected. A successful **GDD** is a collaborative effort, integrated into the team\'s workflow and seen as a shared resource.\\n\\nFinally, some **GDDs** fail by becoming **prescriptive rather than descriptive**. While a **GDD** needs to define the game, it should ideally leave room for creative problem-solving and iteration, especially in areas like art direction or specific level design details which are often best explored during production. A **GDD** that tries to dictate every minute aspect can stifle creativity and become a bottleneck.\\n\\nRecognizing these common pitfalls allows us to approach **GDD** creation with a focus on flexibility, collaboration, appropriate detail, and the selection of suitable tools that facilitate a dynamic documentation process.\\n\\n## Essential Sections and Components of a Comprehensive GDD\\n\\nWhile the specific structure and contents of a **Game Design Document** can vary depending on the project\'s size, genre, and team structure, certain core sections are fundamental to almost every comprehensive **GDD**. These sections provide a holistic view of the game, covering everything from high-level concepts to intricate details.\\n\\n### Game Concept and Genre\\n\\nThis section provides a concise overview of the game. It should clearly articulate the **core concept**, the game\'s unique selling proposition (what makes it stand out), and the target audience.\\n\\n- **Elevator Pitch:** A one or two-sentence summary of the game.\\n- **Genre:** Classification of the game (e.g., RPG, FPS, Puzzle, Strategy). Specifying sub-genres (e.g., Roguelike RPG, Tactical FPS) is helpful.\\n- **Target Audience:** Who is this game being made for? Understanding the player base informs design decisions.\\n- **High-Level Vision:** A slightly more detailed description of the game\'s goals, tone, and overall experience it aims to deliver.\\n- **Inspiration:** List any games, movies, books, or other media that served as inspiration for the project.\\n\\n### Core Gameplay Loop\\n\\nThe **core gameplay loop** is the repeating cycle of actions the player performs most often. This is arguably the most critical part of the **GDD** as it defines the fundamental player experience.\\n\\n- **Primary Actions:** What does the player _do_ repeatedly? (e.g., Explore, Fight, Collect, Craft, Build).\\n- **Cycle Description:** Detail the sequence of actions and rewards that constitute the loop (e.g., Player explores dungeon -> finds treasure -> fights monster -> gains experience/loot -> levels up -> uses loot/skills to explore deeper).\\n- **Motivation:** What drives the player to repeat the loop? (e.g., progression, rewards, discovery, mastery).\\n\\n### Mechanics and Systems\\n\\nThis section delves into the specific rules and systems that govern player interaction and the game world. This is often the largest and most detailed part of the **GDD**.\\n\\n- **Player Mechanics:** Movement, combat, interaction, inventory, abilities, etc. Describe _how_ these work and the player input required.\\n- **Core Systems:** Economy, progression (XP, leveling, skill trees), crafting, inventory management, quest system, dialogue system, AI behaviors, physics interactions. Detail the rules and logic behind these systems.\\n- **Game Rules:** How does the game handle success/failure states, scoring, winning conditions, losing conditions, etc.?\\n- **Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):** How does the player interact with the game visually? Describe menus, HUD elements, control schemes, and overall user flow.\\n\\n### Story, Characters, and Setting\\n\\nIf your game has narrative elements, this section outlines the plot, the world, and the individuals within it.\\n\\n- **Synopsis:** A summary of the game\'s plot.\\n- **Lore and Worldbuilding:** Description of the game world, its history, geography, cultures, and factions.\\n- **Characters:** Detailed descriptions of main and supporting characters, including their personalities, backstories, motivations, and roles in the story.\\n- **Narrative Structure:** How is the story presented? (e.g., linear, branching paths, emergent narrative).\\n- **Dialogue:** Guidelines for writing dialogue, including tone and style.\\n\\n### Art and Audio Style Guides\\n\\nThese sections define the aesthetic and auditory experience of the game, ensuring consistency and setting expectations for the art and sound teams.\\n\\n- **Art Style:** Describe the visual direction (e.g., pixel art, 3D realistic, stylized cartoon). Include mood boards, concept art examples, and color palettes. Specify details like character design principles, environment design, and visual effects.\\n- **User Interface (UI) Art:** Guidelines for the look and feel of menus, buttons, and HUD elements.\\n- **Sound Design:** Describe the overall auditory experience, including music style (genre, mood), sound effects (realistic, stylized), and voice acting requirements.\\n- **Audio Implementation:** How sound and music will be integrated into the game (e.g., adaptive music, positional audio).\\n\\n### Monetization and Platform Targets\\n\\nThis covers the business aspects of the game and where players will be able to access it.\\n\\n- **Monetization Model:** How will the game make money? (e.g., premium purchase, free-to-play with microtransactions, subscription, advertising). Detail the specifics of any in-game purchases or economic systems.\\n- **Platform(s):** Which platforms will the game be released on? (e.g., PC, Console - specify platforms, Mobile - iOS/Android, Web). Specify any platform-specific considerations or requirements.\\n\\n### Other Potential Sections\\n\\nDepending on the complexity and nature of the game, other sections might be necessary:\\n\\n- **Technical Specifications:** Engine choice, required hardware specs, online requirements, networking details.\\n- **Level Design:** Guidelines for creating levels, including principles for pacing, challenges, and environmental storytelling.\\n- **Marketing and Community:** Plans for promoting the game and engaging with the player base.\\n- **Legal and Business:** Information on intellectual property, licensing, and business structure.\\n- **Development Plan/Roadmap:** A high-level overview of the project timeline and milestones.\\n\\nStructuring your **GDD** with these essential sections provides a comprehensive framework that touches upon all critical facets of your game, ensuring no major area is overlooked.\\n\\n## Tools and Methods for Creating and Managing Your GDD\\n\\nThe traditional image of a **Game Design Document** might be a colossal Word document or a sprawling collection of spreadsheets. While these tools can work for very simple projects or specific purposes, they often contribute to the pitfalls discussed earlier \u2013 rigidity, poor collaboration, and difficulty in managing complexity. Modern **game development** benefits greatly from tools and methods that facilitate a more dynamic, collaborative, and organized approach to **GDD** creation and management.\\n\\nOne effective approach is utilizing **wiki-based systems**. Tools like Confluence or even self-hosted MediaWiki instances allow teams to create interconnected pages for different **GDD** sections. This facilitates easy navigation, cross-referencing, and collaborative editing with built-in version history. Wikis excel at organizing large amounts of interconnected information in a non-linear fashion, which suits the often modular nature of game design.\\n\\n**Cloud-based document suites** like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 offer real-time collaboration features that improve upon traditional desktop applications. Multiple team members can edit the document simultaneously, and changes are tracked. While still primarily linear documents, their collaborative features make them more viable for smaller teams or less complex **GDDs**. However, managing intricate relationships between different parts of the document can still be challenging.\\n\\nDedicated **GDD software or project management tools with strong documentation features** are increasingly popular. Some platforms are specifically built for **game development** documentation, offering features like visual linking between concepts, database functionalities for managing assets or mechanics, and integrated task management. These tools often provide more structure and specialized features than general-purpose alternatives, designed to evolve alongside the project. Key features to look for include:\\n\\n- **Modularity:** The ability to break down the document into smaller, manageable, and linkable sections.\\n- **Visual Organization:** Features like mind maps, flowcharts, or visual boards to map out **game mechanics**, systems, or narrative paths.\\n- **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple team members can work on the document concurrently.\\n- **Version Control:** Tracking changes, viewing history, and reverting to previous versions.\\n- **Searchability:** Powerful search functions to quickly find specific information within the document.\\n- **Exportability:** The ability to export the **GDD** data in various formats (e.g., PDF, Markdown) for sharing or backup.\\n\\nRegardless of the specific tool chosen, the key is to select one that aligns with your team\'s size, workflow, and the project\'s complexity. The tool should facilitate, not hinder, the process of documenting and evolving your **game design**. It should make it easy for team members to access, understand, and contribute to the **GDD**, ensuring it remains a central and actively used resource.\\n\\nFor developers seeking a tool specifically designed to overcome the common frustrations with traditional **GDD** methods, solutions exist that prioritize flexibility and collaboration. For instance, [Drafft](https://drafft.dev) offers a visual, modular approach to **game design documentation**. Instead of overwhelming walls of text, it allows developers to build their **GDD** using interconnected, bite-sized modules that can even link directly to other crucial game data, such as **actors**, **scripts**, and **dialogue trees**, often managed or referenced within the same application. This integrated approach is designed to adapt as your game evolves, facilitating real-time collaboration and providing robust version control to track changes effortlessly. Platforms like [Drafft](https://drafft.dev) aim to make the **GDD** a living tool that truly supports iteration and teamwork, ensuring your documentation process accelerates, rather than hinders, your **game development** progress.\\n\\n## Keeping Your Game Design Document Dynamic and Useful\\n\\nCreating a comprehensive **Game Design Document** is a significant first step, but its true value is unlocked only when it remains a living, breathing part of your **game development** process. A static **GDD**, completed early on and then ignored, quickly loses relevance and becomes obsolete. We must actively work to keep it dynamic and useful throughout the project lifecycle.\\n\\nOne of the most important practices is to **integrate GDD updates into your regular workflow**. Treat the **GDD** not as a one-off task, but as an ongoing responsibility. Schedule dedicated time, perhaps at the end of each sprint or development milestone, to review and update relevant sections based on progress, feedback, and design changes. This ensures the document always reflects the current state of the game.\\n\\n**Use the GDD as a central reference point for daily tasks and discussions.** Encourage team members to consult the **GDD** before starting work on a feature or making a design decision. During meetings, refer back to the document to ground discussions in the established design principles. This reinforces the **GDD\'s** authority and habituates the team to rely on it.\\n\\n**Avoid over-detailing too early in development.** While the **GDD** should be comprehensive, it\'s okay for certain sections, particularly those related to later-stage content or highly iterative systems, to remain higher-level initially. As those parts of the game enter active development, then deepen the corresponding sections of the **GDD**. This prevents wasted effort on documenting elements that are likely to change significantly. Focus on locking down the **core gameplay loop** and fundamental mechanics first.\\n\\n**Actively use the GDD for onboarding new team members.** Provide access to the document on their first day and allocate time for them to read through the relevant sections. This is a highly efficient way to get new hires up to speed on the project\'s vision, history, and current status without requiring extensive one-on-one explanations.\\n\\n**Foster a culture of collective ownership over the GDD.** While a lead designer or specific individual might be responsible for the overall structure and consistency, encourage all team members to contribute updates, clarifications, and suggestions to their respective areas of expertise. This not only keeps the document accurate but also empowers the team and strengthens their connection to the project\'s vision.\\n\\n**Regularly review and refactor the GDD.** As the game evolves, the structure and organization of the **GDD** might need adjustments. Periodically step back and assess whether the document is easy to navigate, whether the information is logically organized, and if any sections have become unnecessarily complex or redundant. Refactoring the **GDD** can make it more accessible and maintainable.\\n\\nBy adopting these practices, the **Game Design Document** transitions from a static binder on a shelf to a vital, dynamic tool that genuinely supports the entire **game development** process, ensuring alignment, managing complexity, and driving the project towards successful completion.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe **Game Design Document (GDD)** is far more than just a bureaucratic requirement; it is a critical tool for success in **game development**. We have explored what a **GDD** is \u2013 a dynamic blueprint outlining the game\'s vision, mechanics, story, and technical aspects \u2013 and why it is essential for clarity, scope management, communication, and attracting support.\\n\\nWe have also highlighted the common pitfalls that cause **GDDs** to fail, such as becoming static, overly detailed too early, or being managed with unsuitable tools. Understanding these challenges allows developers to approach **GDD** creation with a focus on building a flexible, collaborative, and adaptable document.\\n\\nThe essential sections discussed \u2013 from the core concept and **gameplay loop** to detailed **mechanics**, story, art, audio, and business considerations \u2013 provide a comprehensive framework for capturing the entirety of the game\'s design. By detailing these components, teams establish a shared understanding and a clear roadmap.\\n\\nFinally, we emphasized the importance of keeping the **GDD** alive and useful throughout development. Integrating updates into workflow, using it as a central reference, avoiding premature detail, leveraging it for onboarding, fostering team ownership, and periodic refactoring are all practices that ensure the **GDD** remains a valuable asset, guiding the project through iteration and refinement.\\n\\nWhether you are embarking on your first **indie game development** project or managing a large team, investing the time and effort into creating and maintaining a robust, dynamic **Game Design Document** is one of the most impactful decisions you can make to ensure your creative vision is fully realized and successfully brought to players. It transforms abstract ideas into a clear, actionable plan, making the complex journey of **game development** significantly more manageable and likely to succeed.\\n\\n<div className=\\"bg-dark-background-darker-3 py-2 p-8 pb-8 rounded-lg\\">\\n  <GetStartedCTA showTitle={false} showDescription={true} showLearnMore={true} />\\n</div>"},{"id":"drafft-items-editor","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/drafft-items-editor","editUrl":"https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-website/edit/main/blog/2025-03-30-drafft-items-editor.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-30-drafft-items-editor.mdx","title":"Introducing the Items Editor: A More Flexible Way to Structure Your Game Data","description":"Discover how Drafft\'s new Items Editor allows game developers to manage unstructured data dynamically while maintaining a structured workflow.","date":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Game Development","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-development","description":"Game development tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Game Design","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-design"},{"inline":false,"label":"Tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/tools","description":"Tools tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Workflow","permalink":"/blog/tags/workflow","description":"Workflow tag description"},{"inline":true,"label":"data-management","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-management"}],"readingTime":2.12,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Drafft","title":"Drafft Team","url":"https://drafft.dev","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/drafft"},"email":"baj@drafft.dev","socials":{"website":"https://drafft.dev","x":"https://x.com/DrafftApp","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/drafftapp.bsky.social","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@drafftapp","itchio":"https://drafft.itch.io"},"imageURL":"https://drafft.dev/img/logo.webp","key":"drafft"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing the Items Editor: A More Flexible Way to Structure Your Game Data","description":"Discover how Drafft\'s new Items Editor allows game developers to manage unstructured data dynamically while maintaining a structured workflow.","authors":"drafft","date":"2025-03-30","tags":["game-development","game-design","tools","workflow","data-management"],"slug":"drafft-items-editor"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What Is a Game Design Document?

This unopinionated stance is not a missing feature; rather, it\'s a deliberate choice that empowers you in several key ways:\\n\\n### Flexibility and Freedom\\n\\n- **Your Assets, Your Rules:**  \\n  Drafft does not impose a predefined engine or gameplay loop. This means you have complete freedom to choose or build the engine that best fits your vision. Whether you want to integrate your assets with Ren\'Py, Godot, or a custom-built solution, Drafft\'s centralized management system provides the flexibility you need.\\n\\n### Centralized Game Design Asset Management\\n\\n- **Single Source of Truth:**  \\n  All your narrative elements\u2014from branching dialogue trees to comprehensive GDDs\u2014are stored in one place. This centralization reduces confusion, eliminates redundancy, and streamlines collaboration.\\n- **Enhanced Collaboration and Version Control:**  \\n  Real-time updates and robust version control ensure that teams can work together seamlessly. Writers, designers, and developers can iterate quickly without fear of overwriting or losing critical data.\\n\\n### Seamless Integration with Your Favorite Tools\\n\\n- **Standardized JSON Export:**  \\n  Easily export your design assets in a format that integrates seamlessly with any game engine.\\n- **REST API Access:**  \\n  Consume game design assets directly from your engine. This feature improves development iterations and allows you to experiment with new ideas on the fly without disrupting your established workflow.\\n\\n## Turning a Potential Limitation into a Strength\\n\\nSome might view the absence of a built-in engine or scripted dialogue logic as a drawback. However, this unopinionated design is a key strength of Drafft:\\n\\n- **Focus on What Matters:**  \\n  By not dictating how the narrative logic should work, Drafft lets you concentrate on what\'s most important\u2014crafting engaging stories and well-organized design assets.\\n- **Tailored Implementation:**  \\n  Developers can integrate their preferred gameplay loop or narrative engine, ensuring that the technical implementation aligns perfectly with their creative vision.\\n- **Future-Proof Development:**  \\n  As your project evolves, you\'re free to change or upgrade your engine without having to migrate your entire asset management system. This flexibility makes Drafft an adaptable and scalable solution for long-term projects.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile traditional visual novel tools offer out-of-the-box solutions, they often come with limitations that can hinder complex narrative development and collaboration. Drafft\'s focus on centralized game design asset management\u2014and its intentionally unopinionated approach\u2014empowers you with the flexibility, collaboration, and seamless integration needed to bring your vision to life.\\n\\nReady to take your visual novel development to the next level?

Like, you\u2019ve got this amazing game idea bouncing around in your head, but the moment you try to put it on paper, it feels like herding cats?  \\n\\nLet\u2019s break it down together, friend to friend. No jargon, no fluff\u2014just real talk about how to write a GDD that doesn\u2019t make you want to throw your laptop out the window.  \\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n---\\n\\n## What Even Is a GDD? (And Why Should You Care?)  \\n\\nOkay, first things first. A Game Design Document, or GDD, is basically the blueprint for your game. It\u2019s where you jot down all your ideas, mechanics, characters, and storylines so you (and your team) don\u2019t end up with a hot mess of confusion later. Think of it like a recipe. You wouldn\u2019t try to bake a cake without knowing the ingredients, right? Same deal here.  \\n\\nBut here\u2019s the thing: a GDD doesn\u2019t have to be this intimidating, 50-page monstrosity. In fact, some of the best GDDs I\u2019ve seen are short, sweet, and to the point. It\u2019s all about clarity, not volume.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Start with the Big Picture  \\n\\nBefore you dive into the nitty-gritty, ask yourself: *What\u2019s the heart of my game?* Is it a cozy farming sim where players grow magical potatoes? Or maybe it\u2019s a gritty cyberpunk RPG where every decision has consequences? Whatever it is, nail down the core concept first.  \\n\\nI like to start with a one-liner, almost like an elevator pitch. For example: *\u201cA time-traveling chef who must save the world by cooking historical dishes.\u201d* Boom. You instantly get the vibe, right? From there, you can expand into the story, setting, and characters.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Keep It Flexible (Because Things *Will* Change)  \\n\\nHere\u2019s a little secret: your GDD is not set in stone. In fact, it\u2019s more like a living document. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve written a GDD, only to realize halfway through development that a mechanic just isn\u2019t working. And that\u2019s okay! The beauty of indie game development is the freedom to adapt and iterate.  \\n\\nSo, don\u2019t stress about making it perfect. Focus on making it clear and actionable. Use bullet points, sketches, or even memes if that helps get your point across. (Yes, I\u2019ve totally included memes in a GDD before. No regrets.)  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Break It Down into Sections  \\n\\nNow, let\u2019s talk structure. Here\u2019s a simple framework I use:  \\n\\n1. **Overview**: That one-liner I mentioned earlier.  \\n2. **Gameplay Mechanics**: How does the game actually work? What do players do?  \\n3. **Story and Characters**: Who are they, and why should players care?  \\n4. **Art and Sound**: What\u2019s the visual and audio style?  \\n5. **Level Design**: How does the game progress?  \\n6. **Technical Requirements**: Any special tools or platforms you\u2019re using?  \\n\\nYou don\u2019t need to write a novel for each section. Just enough so that anyone reading it can understand your vision.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Secret Sauce: Make It Fun to Read  \\n\\nHere\u2019s the thing: a GDD isn\u2019t just for you. It\u2019s for your team, your investors, and maybe even your future players. So, make it enjoyable to read! Throw in some humor, use relatable examples, and don\u2019t be afraid to let your personality shine through.  \\n\\nI once wrote a GDD where I described the main character as \u201ca cross between a disgruntled raccoon and a retired rock star.\u201d Did it make sense? Not really. But it got the point across, and it made my team laugh. And honestly, that\u2019s half the battle.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Wrapping It Up  \\n\\nSo, there you have it. Writing a GDD doesn\u2019t have to be a nightmare. Start with the big picture, keep it flexible, and don\u2019t forget to have fun with it. And hey, if all else fails, just remember: even the most successful games started with a messy first draft.  \\n\\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling stuck, grab a coffee (or tea, no judgment), take a deep breath, and just start writing. Or better yet, check out **[Drafft](https://drafftapp.com)**, the ultimate tool for crafting GDDs that are as fun to write as they are to read. It\u2019s like having a creative partner who never judges your raccoon-rock-star hybrid ideas.  \\n\\nP.S. If you\u2019re into magical potatoes or time-traveling chefs, hit me up. I\u2019ve got ideas.  \\n\\n<div className=\\"bg-dark-background-darker-3 py-2 p-8 pb-8 rounded-lg\\">\\n  <GetStartedCTA showTitle={false} showDescription={true}/>\\n</div>"},{"id":"easier-ways-to-write-game-dialogue","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/easier-ways-to-write-game-dialogue","editUrl":"https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-website/edit/main/blog/2025-01-30-easier-ways-to-write-game-dialogues.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-30-easier-ways-to-write-game-dialogues.mdx","title":"Easier Ways to Write Game Dialogue | Scripting Editor, GDD Editor & More","description":"Writing dialogue in game engines like Unreal or Unity can be frustrating.

Their blueprint and scripting systems work well for basic interactions, and many AAA games have used them. However, things quickly get messy when creating a story-driven or visual novel game. Conversations get crammed into tiny, hard-to-read boxes that make it nearly impossible to track flow, debug efficiently, or make changes without fundamentally breaking something.\\n\\nAs your project and ambition grow, so too does the headache of managing the tangled mess of dialogue. For larger-scale projects, that sometimes means dealing with thousands of lines of text and hundreds of dialogue choices. That\u2019s where Drafft comes in. Drafft is designed specifically with game writers in mind. It streamlines dialogue creation with a non-linear dialogue editor, an advanced scripting system, a powerful GDD (Game Design Document) editor, and more.\\n\\nBelow, we explore how Drafft\u2019s game-changing features make writing, organizing, and implementing dialogue easier.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n## Tools That Make Writing Game Dialogue Easier\\n\\nOne major feature that Drafft has to offer is a **Non-Linear Dialogue Tree Editor**. This tool provides a visual tree structure to map out dialogue, letting game developers easily navigate their work. No matter how large your narrative game becomes, the branches stay neat and organized so you don\u2019t have to worry about sorting through a jumbled mess. You can also easily switch to the **Script Editor**, saving precious time as you write the dialogue for NPCs, cutscenes, or player interactions.\\n\\nThe **advanced Script Editor** allows you to generate industry-standard screenplay documents and share them with directors or voice actors. The built-in script player lets you simulate dialogue flow in gameplay, ensuring natural interactions. Meanwhile, smart parsing automatically detects dialogue tags, commands, and emotions, categorizing them for easy organization. It supports multiple languages and converts scripts into JSON.\\n\\nThe **GDD Editor** helps you organize your dialogue, character sheets, and worldbuilding in one place. You can attach images, videos, and audio directly to the document to help refine a character\u2019s personality as you plan their arc. It also lets you create, organize, and share your documents as a PDF or JSON.\\n\\n## Other Features Drafft Offers\\n\\nDrafft prioritizes **full data ownership and security**, enabling users to work locally or with their own CouchDB setup\u2014eliminating reliance on the cloud. You can export all your documents and data to JSON or any other format tailored for game engines. With **real-time multi-user collaboration**, teams can sync changes instantly to keep the workflow smooth and efficient.\\n\\nDrafft also features a **comprehensive repository system** for managing quests, items, and game assets in plain text or in formats like JSON, TOML, and HJSON. Developers can utilize **API access** for automation and tool integration. On top of it all, you don\u2019t have to worry about your platform since Drafft runs on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**.\\n\\n## Final Thoughts on Easier Ways to Write Game Dialogue\\n\\nWriting complex dialogue in game engines can be overwhelming, but Drafft provides an organized and intuitive solution tailored for game writers and dialogue-heavy games. Whether you\u2019re working on a visual novel, an RPG, or any story-driven experience, Drafft\u2019s **Non-Linear Dialogue Tree Editor**, **advanced Script Editor**, and **comprehensive GDD Editor** help keep your dialogue structured, effective, and natural. With these user-friendly and stress-relieving features, you can focus on creating great dialogue that enhances the player\u2019s experience and ensures every bit of dialogue keeps them immersed.\\n\\n\\n<div className=\\"bg-dark-background-darker-3 py-2 p-8 pb-8 rounded-lg\\">\\n <GetStartedCTA showTitle={false} showDescription={true}/>\\n</div>"},{"id":"how-i-solved-game-dev-headaches-built-drafft","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-i-solved-game-dev-headaches-built-drafft","editUrl":"https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-website/edit/main/blog/2025-01-22-how-i-solved-game-dev-headaches-built-drafft.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-22-how-i-solved-game-dev-headaches-built-drafft.mdx","title":"How I Solved My Biggest Game Development Headaches (and Why I Built Drafft)","description":"Social Preview Image","date":"2025-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Game Development","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-development","description":"Game development tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Workflow","permalink":"/blog/tags/workflow","description":"Workflow tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"JSON","permalink":"/blog/tags/json","description":"JSON tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Collaboration","permalink":"/blog/tags/collaboration","description":"Collaboration tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Scripts","permalink":"/blog/tags/scripts","description":"Scripts tag description"}],"readingTime":3.445,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Drafft","title":"Drafft Team","url":"https://drafft.dev","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/drafft"},"email":"baj@drafft.dev","socials":{"website":"https://drafft.dev","x":"https://x.com/DrafftApp","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/drafftapp.bsky.social","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@drafftapp","itchio":"https://drafft.itch.io"},"imageURL":"https://drafft.dev/img/logo.webp","key":"drafft"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How I Solved My Biggest Game Development Headaches (and Why I Built Drafft)","slug":"how-i-solved-game-dev-headaches-built-drafft","authors":"drafft","date":"2025-01-22","tags":["game-development","workflow","json","collaboration","scripts"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Easier Ways to Write Game Dialogue | Scripting Editor, GDD Editor & More","permalink":"/blog/easier-ways-to-write-game-dialogue"},"nextItem":{"title":"Breaking Free from Traditional Tools: A Better Way to Write Game Dialogues","permalink":"/blog/breaking-free-from-traditional-tools--a-better-way-to-write-game-dialogues"}},"content":"import GetStartedCTA from \\"@site/src/components/cta/GetStartedCTA\\";\\nimport Link from \\"@docusaurus/Link\\";\\n\\n![Social Preview Image](/img/drafft-social-card.webp)\\n\\n_If you\u2019ve ever spent hours battling clunky text editors, lost time waiting for game engine recompiles, or struggled to collaborate on scripts, you\u2019re not alone. As a game developer, I hit a breaking point managing scripts and dialogue trees\u2014until I built Drafft. Here\u2019s why._\\n\\n## {/* truncate */}\\n\\n## The Problems That Drove Me Crazy\\n\\n### 1. Trapped in the Engine: Slow Compilation and Inflexible Scripts\\n\\nI used to embed scripts and dialogue directly in my game engine (Unity, in my case). It seemed convenient at first, but soon became a nightmare:\\n\\n- **Slow iteration**: Every script change required a full recompile. Waiting 2-3 minutes just to test a dialogue tweak? No thanks.\\n- **Brittle workflows**: Scripts compiled into the game binary. Updating content meant rebuilding the entire project.\\n- **Zero separation**: Code and content were tangled together. Want to reuse a script? Good luck extracting it.\\n\\n### 2. Text Editors That Felt Like Stone Age Tools\\n\\nGame engine text editors are\u2026 not great. Mine lacked:\\n\\n- Syntax highlighting for JSON/scripts\\n- Search/replace across files\\n- Autocomplete or error checking\\n\\nEditing JSON in Unity\u2019s textbox felt like coding with oven mitts on.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The \u201cAha\u201d Moment (and the New Problem)\\n\\n### Taking Content Out of the Engine\\n\\nI moved scripts and data into external files. **Benefits**:\\n\\n- Test changes without recompiling the game\\n- Reuse content across projects\\n- Version control scripts/dialogue separately\\n- _Plain text_ files!\\n\\n**But then**: Managing hundreds of text/JSON files became its own nightmare:\\n\\n```json\\n// Example of the JSON chaos:\\n{\\n  \\"dialogue\\": {\\n    \\"scene1\\": {\\n      \\"npc1_line1\\": \\"Hello, adventurer!\\",\\n      \\"npc1_line2\\": \\"Did you know JSON brackets love to mismatch?\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- **Tedious formatting**: Missing a comma? Enjoy debugging 500 lines of JSON.\\n- **No hierarchy**: A folder of 300 JSON files isn\u2019t a \u201cworkflow\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a ticking bomb.\\n- **Zero collaboration**: Git merges for dialogue trees? _Shudder_.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![script-editor](/img/scripts/scripts-01.webp)\\n\\n## Why I Built Drafft\\n\\n### The Final Straw: Expensive Tools for Indie Teams\\n\\nWhen I realized I needed a better solution, I looked at tools like **Articy:Draft**. It had some great features, but:\\n\\n- **Prohibitively expensive**: As an indie team of two, we couldn\u2019t justify the cost.\\n- **Overkill for our needs**: We didn\u2019t need all the bells and whistles\u2014just a simple, efficient way to manage scripts and data.\\n- **Subscription required**: Monthly fees added up quickly.\\n- **Cloud dependency**: Required constant internet access and data storage on their servers.\\n  o\\n  That\u2019s when I decided to build **Drafft**: a tool designed **by indie devs, for indie devs**. Affordable, lightweight, and laser-focused on solving the problems we actually faced.\\n\\n### 1. Hierarchy Meets Database Power\\n\\n```Yaml\\n- Game Design\\n  - Scripts\\n    - Chapter1\\n    - Chapter2\\n  - Dialogue Trees\\n    - NPCs\\n      - Merchant\\n  - Actors\\n    - Actor Nam\\n```\\n\\nOrganize scripts, dialogue, and data in a unified structure. Search, sort, and edit like a database\u2014without losing the familiarity of folders.\\n\\n### 2.Commom Code Editor Goodies for Game Devs\\n\\n- **Syntax highlighting**: JSON, scripts, and custom formats.\\n- **Code folding**: Collapse and expand sections for better readability.\\n- **Undo/Redo**: Never lose your work with unlimited undo/redo.\\n- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with customizable shortcuts.\\n- **Find and replace**: Quickly make changes across your entire project.\\n\\n### 3. JSON Export Without the Headaches\\n\\n- One-click export to game-ready JSON.\\n- Edit scripts **while the game runs** (no more recompiles!).\\n\\n### 4. Collaboration That Just Works\\n\\n- Real-time syncing.\\n- Work offline and merge changes later.\\n\\n### 5. Your Data, Your Rules\\n\\n- **No cloud lock-in**: Data lives on your machine.\\n- **No subscriptions**: Pay once, own it forever.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Drafft Saved My Sanity (and Can Save Yours)\\n\\nSince switching to Drafft:\\n\\n- Cut iteration time by **70%** by editing scripts while the game runs.\\n- Eliminated JSON errors with built-in validation.\\n- Collaborated seamlessly with a remote writer on dialogue trees.\\n\\n**Still fighting your tools?** Drafft\u2019s free to download.
