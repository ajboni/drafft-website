While rendering remains unaffected, dialogue logic depending solely on `handle.id` may misbehave.\n\n  \ud83d\udca1 **Recommendation** (for users writing their own implementation systems using the exported JSON):\n\n  If you\'re using handle IDs in your own game logic, I strongly suggest resolving connections using both the **node ID** and the **handle ID**.\n  For example, prefer a lookup based on `(node.id + handle.id)` or use a neighbor traversal pattern that scopes edges per node \u2014 similar to the `getNeighborNodes()` helper used internally.\n\n  \ud83d\udd27 A fallback workaround is in place, and a migration script will be available in the near future.\n\n- fix: Fix dialogue player tooltip showing wrong text.

(thanks @Sin)\n- fix: Fix UAF highlight regex to support special characters. (!@#$%^&\\*+\\_,;?\') (thanks @Sin)\n- fix: Support for special characters in command/speech export mapping.

This will allow you to set how many backups to keep in the auto export folder.(thanks @Maez)\n- feat: Add enter/escape support for all doc creation modals (thanks @MrFrips)\n- feat: Add shortcut key for quick export game content (CTRL+F8) and export game content (CTRL+SHIFT+F8)\n- fix: Context menu actions crashing when adding children to a folder.

While the core functionality remains largely unchanged, I added several new features to enhance the experience. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new:\n\n### General\n\n#### Tabs\n\nPreviously, you could only edit one document at a time. Now, **multi-tab editing** is here! Open multiple documents in tabs for faster workflows. There is also a **\u201cDiff\u201d feature**, allowing you to preview and undo changes before saving. Tabs can be manually saved or rolled back, similar to VSCode\u2019s behavior.\n\n#### Pick Anything\n\n- **The Picker**: A powerful tool for searching, picking, and linking documents or assets. For example, in a GDD document, you can insert a link to a script or image, and clicking the link will open it in a new tab.\n- **Navigation**: Press `Ctrl+P` to search for any document by name, collection, or ID. Drafft also supports custom protocol URLs like `drafft://gdd/unique-id-of-the-document`, making it easy to share or link documents.\n- **Command Picker**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+:` to search for and run commands instantly, like unlocking a document or loading a project.\n- **Favorites**: Mark documents as favorites for quick access.\n\n#### Document Info, Revisions and Individual JSON Download\n\n- A new document info panel is available, which shows useful information about a document as well as its revision history.\n- Thanks to **PouchDB/CouchDB**, Drafft now supports **document revision history**. Track changes, restore previous versions , and never lose progress again.\n- The whole document JSON (or any of its revisions, up to 15) can be downloaded from this info panel.\n\n#### Media Library\n\nImage and attachment support used to be\u2026 rudimentary. Images were serialized as base64 strings, bloating the document content. With **PouchDB\u2019s attachment support**, we\u2019ve built a proper **media library** that lets you reuse assets across documents without duplication.\n\n### Misc\n\n- All documents content now lives under the `content` property, enabling sub-objects like `content.text`, `content.bio`, and `content.properties`.\n- Project manager now shows reads all databases from storage and shows actual project metadata.\n- A sample project can now be downloaded from the project manager, for quickly trying out things.\n- The app now remembers the user\u2019s zoom factor and sidebar status.\n- The app now makes an automatic backup of the project once it\u2019s open (up to 10 versions).\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n- App-wide shortcuts for common actions have been added to streamline workflows.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- A new **landing page**, **domain**, and **documentation site** are live at [https://drafft.dev](https://drafft.dev).\n\n### Dialogues\n\n- A new, more intuitive dialogue editor with better node management and a cleaner/ UI.\n- Vertical / Horizontal Layout\n- Scripts can be loaded into sub tabs in the dialogue editor view.\n- Any node can have any number of in/out ports.\n- Context menu for common actions (Edit, Delete, Clone).\n- A drawer for node configuration (inputs, outputs, title, metadata).\n- Nodes can link to ANY script in the project, whether its autogenerated by the dialog editor (dialogue folder), or any user created script. This also allows to share the same script between multiple dialogues/nodes. This also allows users to tweak a script on the script section (without having to open the dialogue editor) and see the changes reflected on the dialogue editor. The drawback is that now users need to "lock" the script to be able to edit it, even in the dialogue editor. There might be an option to "Autolock all related scripts" in the future.\n- Adding scripts to a dialogue node is optional.\n- Grid snapping option\n- Duplicate nodes\n- New nodes, making the final list as follows:\n  - Jump: Jump to a specific node. (new)\n  - Note: A sticky note node.(new)\n  - Script: A node with a script.\n  - Choice: A branching node with multiple options.\n  - Start: The beginning of a dialogue.\n  - End: The end of a dialogue.\n  - Return: Return to the previous choice.\n- Nodes can have additional notes and metadata\n- Undo/Redo support.\n\n### GDDs\n\n#### Embrace the Markdown\n\nRich text support is being dropped in favor of **Markdown**. To make this transition seamless, the editor has been revamped to be as close to **WYSIWYG** as possible while maintaining clean, human-readable Markdown. Drafft now uses the **mdxeditor library**, which brings a host of features like tables, image resizing, diff/preview/source modes, and maybe future MDX support.\n\n---\n\n### Script Editor\n\n- **Autocomplete**: The script editor now supports autocomplete for Actors (`::ActorName::`) and Commands (`::CommandName::`). Future updates will expand this to include items, quests, and more.\n- Doc picker can be use to insert an actor, command, script or any other item.\n- **Inline JSON Highlighting**: Inline JSON is now highlighted and validated for better readability and error detection.\n\n### Actors\n\n- Actor expressions are now stored as **attachments**, making them easier to manage and reuse across different actors and GDDs.\n- All actor content (bio, properties, `expression_ids`, etc.) now lives under the `content` property.\n\n### Tailwind\n\nGoodbye, `antd`\u2014hello, **Tailwind**! Overriding CSS classes has been a time-consuming hassle, but no more. With Tailwind, creating custom styles and layouts is now faster and easier, ensuring a more consistent look across the app. While the migration has been time-intensive, the payoff will be worth it.\n\nThat\u2019s it for Drafft v2! We\u2019re excited for you to try out these new features and let us know what you think.
