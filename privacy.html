<h3 align="center"><p>Last Updated:<strong> March 15, 2025</strong></p></h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p><p>This privacy policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>”) describes how <strong>Alexis Boni in Argentina</strong> <!-- -->
(“<strong>Drafft,</strong>” “<strong>we,</strong>” and “<strong>our</strong>”)
processes, collects, uses and shares personal data when using this website <a href="https://drafft.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://drafft.dev</a> (the “
<strong>Website</strong>”). Please read the following information carefully to understand our practices regarding
your personal data and how we will process data.</p><p></p>
<h2>Purposes of Processing</h2>
<p><strong>What is personal data?</strong><br></p><p>Within the context of this Policy, we collect various forms of information, encompassing what is commonly referred to
as &quot;personal data.&quot; As delineated in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the term &quot;personal data&quot; pertains
to any information that, either individually or when amalgamated with other data under our purview, serves to uniquely
identify you as an individual. Such data may encompass, but is not restricted to, particulars such as your name,
postal address, email address, and telephone number.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your personal data?</strong><br></p><p>Our processing of personal data adheres strictly to the provisions outlined in relevant data protection and privacy
legislation. The collection of specific personal data is indispensable for the provision of access to our website.
When you registered with us, you were duly prompted to provide your consent, signifying your willingness to furnish
this information to facilitate access to our services, product acquisition, or content perusal. This consent
establishes the requisite legal foundation under applicable law for the processing of your data. It is important to
note that you retain the prerogative to revoke this consent at any juncture. If you dissent with our utilization of
your personal data in consonance with the tenets expounded in this Policy, we kindly beseech you to refrain from using
our website.</p><p></p>
<h2>Collecting Your Personal Data</h2>
<p></p><p>We collect information about you in the following ways:</p><br><p><strong>Information You Give Us.</strong> This includes:<strong></strong></p><p></p>
<ul><li><p>the personal data you provide when you register to use our website, including your name, postal address, email
address, telephone number, username, password and demographic information (such as your gender);<strong></strong></p></li><li><p>the personal data that may be contained in any video, comment or other submission you upload or post to the website;</p></li><li><p>the personal data you provide in connection with our rewards program and other promotions we run on the website;</p><strong></strong></li><li><p>the personal data you provide when you report a problem with our website or when we provide you with customer

<p><strong><p>Information from Social Networking Websites. <br></p></strong></p><p>Our website includes interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each a “SNS”). If you
connect to a SNS through our website, you authorize us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS
could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with
this Policy. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate
settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Information Automatically Collected.</strong> <br>
We automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our website. For example,
when visiting our website, we log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model,
browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing to our website, pages you viewed,
how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our website. We collect this
information about you using cookies.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>Automated Decision Making and Profiling. </strong><br></p><p>We do not use your personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making. However, we may do so in order to
fulfill obligations imposed by law, in which case we will inform you of any such processing and provide you with an
opportunity to object.</p><p></p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong><br></p><p>The collection of information through the employment of &quot;cookies&quot; is a practice that we may undertake. Cookies, in
this context, represent diminutive data files that are housed within the hard drive of your computing apparatus or
mobile device by a given website. Our usage encompasses two primary categories of cookies: session cookies, which have
a transitory existence and expire upon the closure of your web browser, and persistent cookies, which endure on your
computing apparatus or mobile device until you choose to remove them. These cookies are instrumental in providing you
with an enhanced, individualized, and interactive experience during your interaction with our website.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>Two Distinct Categories of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Our utilization of cookies comprises two distinct classifications:</p>
<ol><li><p></p><p><strong>First Party Cookies</strong>: These are directly dispensed by us to your computing apparatus or mobile
device, serving the sole purpose of recognizing your computing apparatus or mobile device when you revisit our
website.</p><p></p></li><li><p></p><p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>: These are administered by service providers who operate on our website.
Service providers may harness these cookies to identify your computing apparatus or mobile device not only on our
website but also during its visits to other websites.</p><p></p></li></ol>
<p></p><p>Cookies are instrumental in enhancing the functionality and personalization of your web experience, thereby
facilitating an enriched user interaction with our website.
<strong>Cookies we use</strong></p><br><p>Our website uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p><p></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="145" valign="top"><strong>Type of cookie</strong></td><td width="323" valign="top"><p><strong>Purpose </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td width="145" valign="top"><p><em>Essential Cookies </em></p></td><td width="323" valign="top"><p></p><p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our website and to enable you to use
some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our website and help the content
of the pages you request load quickly.<strong> </strong>Without these cookies, the services that you have asked
for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td width="145" valign="top"><p><em>Functionality Cookies</em></p></td><td width="323" valign="top"><p></p><p>These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make when you use our website, such as remembering your
language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our
website which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience
and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our website.<!-- --> </p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td width="145" valign="top"><p><em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em></p></td><td width="323" valign="top"><p></p><p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our website and how users use our website. The
information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. It includes the number of visitors to our
website, the websites that referred them to our website, the pages they visited on our website, what time of day
they visited our website, whether they have visited our website before, and other similar information. We use
this information to help operate our website more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to
monitor the level of activity on our website.</p><p></p><p></p><p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how
our website works.

to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar
interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to
enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party
websites.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting<!-- --> </p><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices"><p><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices</a></p></a><p>. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant
to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that
serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored
adverts from companies that are not listed.</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td width="145" height="63" valign="top"><p><em>Social Media Cookies</em></p></td><td width="323" valign="top"><p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button

<p><strong>Disabling cookies</strong><br></p><p>It is generally feasible to eliminate or decline the use of cookies by adjusting your browser settings. To effect
this, kindly adhere to the guidance presented by your browser, typically accessible within the &quot;settings,&quot; &quot;help,&quot;
&quot;tools,&quot; or &quot;edit&quot; features. The majority of browsers are initially configured to accept cookies until such time as
you make modifications to your settings.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Potential Implications: </strong>Should you opt not to accept our cookies, it is conceivable that you may
encounter certain inconveniences while utilizing our website. For instance, there may be an inability to recognize
your computing apparatus or mobile device, necessitating repeated login procedures on each visit to our website.</p><p></p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p></p><p>We may use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the website. These companies may
collect and use click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled
over during your visits to the website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use tracking technologies to collect this information.
