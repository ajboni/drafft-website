# Drafft – Game Development Data Management

This repository contains the **official website and documentation** for **Drafft**, a game development tool designed to help developers **structure, manage, and centralize game data**.

Drafft is built for **indie game developers and small teams** who want more structure than raw files, without the rigidity of heavyweight tools.

## 🎮 What is Drafft?

Drafft is a **game data management tool** focused on the parts of development that are usually scattered across spreadsheets, documents, and ad-hoc JSON files:

- Items, quests, dialogue trees, and game design documents (GDDs)
- Flexible, developer-controlled schemas
- Support for JSON, HJSON, TOML, YAML, and plain text
- Clean exports for direct use in game engines
- No vendor lock-in — you always own your data

Drafft acts as a **single source of truth** for game design data, while remaining engine-agnostic and workflow-friendly.
