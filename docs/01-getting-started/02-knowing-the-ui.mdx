description: This section provides an overview of the user interface and its components.

Once a project is loaded or created, the left sidebar content will change with all available modules of the app. We will quickly visit each one to get a general overview of the features.

### Options

You should setup your username here if you are planning to use it in a team. Other options are self explanatory.

### Project Manager

This is where you can create, load, delete and restore projects. Not much to do here now.

### Project Settings

This is where you can set up project options and metadata and certain default behaviours.  
A very important section here is the **Export Options** page where you can set up different mappings that will be applied when generating the game export as well as what sections will be exported.

### Design Documents

Here is the place where to add documents, notes, story bits, etc.
You will notice the loaded project has a "summary" document, if you try to edit it you will not be able to do so. That's because the document is not "locked for editing".

### Editing documents

Drafft supports realtime collaboration, with the condition that each user "locks" the document that they are working on to avoid concurrency issues.  
Even when using the app as a single user, each document will need to be locked before it being able to be modified.

Go ahead and click the edit button on the toolbar. Some actions on the toolbar like delete or rename will be available now. Also notice that there should be a padlock icon with your username simbolizing the status of the document.

> You can press <kbd>F2</kbd> to lock a document. There are also other useful [keyboard shortcuts](../keyboard-shortcuts.mdx)

Make some changes to the file and click the save button. The file icon should disappear and the file will be available to other user.

You can have a play exploring the file creation or editing processes. Once ready lets move to the script section.
