description: This section provides an overview of the user interface and its components.

Once a project is loaded or created, the left sidebar content will change with all available modules of the app. We will quickly visit each one to get a general overview of the features.

### Options

You should setup your username here if you are planning to use it in a team. Other options are self explanatory.

### Project Manager

This is where you can create, load, delete and restore projects. Not much to do here now.

### Project Settings

This is where you can set up project options and metadata and certain default behaviours.  
A very important section here is the **Export Options** page where you can set up different mappings that will be applied when generating the game export as well as what sections will be exported.

## Design Documents

Here is the place where you can add design documents, notes, story bits, and anything else related to your game world and structure.

You’ll notice the loaded project has a default **"summary"** document. If you try to edit it, you won’t be able to — that’s because it isn’t currently _locked for editing_.

:::tip What does "locked for editing" mean?
Think of it like a **check-out** system — similar to how SharePoint or some team tools prevent simultaneous edits.

When you _lock_ a document, you’re telling Drafft: “I’m working on this. Don’t let others overwrite my changes.”

Once you’re done, you can unlock it so others can edit again.

This avoids accidental edits and keeps collaboration clean — even if you're working solo.
:::

Go ahead and click the edit button on the toolbar. Some actions on the toolbar like delete or rename will be available now.
Also notice that, since version 2.1.17, instead of a padlock icon, the document name will change color: it appears in the primary color if you have it locked for editing, or in dark gray if it’s locked by another user. If the document is unlocked, the text appears in the normal color. Hovering over a document in the tree will show more information about its status.

:::tip
You can press <kbd>F2</kbd> to lock a document. There are also other useful [keyboard shortcuts](../keyboard-shortcuts.mdx)
:::

Make some changes to the file and click the save button. The file icon should disappear and the file will be available to other user.

You can have a play exploring the file creation or editing processes. Once ready lets move to the script section.
