# Quick Start

A good way to start experimenting with the app is to load a sample project and play around.  
Currently, there are two very basic projects:

1. [The Goddess of Fate](https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/The%20goddess%20of%20fate..json): A dialogue-based visual novel about the zodiac.
2. [One Bullet](https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/One%20Bullet.json): A mockup for a point-and-click game about a heist. Work in progress.

> If you want to contribute your project to this section, please make a pull request on the [examples repo](https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples).

## Importing a Project

1. Download the example project JSON file: for this document, we will use [The Goddess of Fate](https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/The%20goddess%20of%20fate..json): A dialogue-based visual novel about the zodiac.
2. Launch the app.
3. Go to **Project Manager** and click on **Restore Database from File in a New Project**.
4. Enter a name and click OK.
5. Select the JSON file. The project will load.
