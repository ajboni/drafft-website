# Quick Start

A good way to start experimenting with the app is to load a sample project and play around.

## Importing a Project

Importing a project is much easier in Drafft 2, there is a button to Download a Sample project directly in the project manager screen.
Each time you click this button the sample project will load under a unique name allowing you to quickly spawn different versions to try things out.

This project is also open to contributions, feel free to make a pull request on the [examples repo](https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/v2/tgof.json).
