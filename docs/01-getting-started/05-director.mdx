## Director Section

In the Director section we will find a list of Actors and properties that we can fill for our game.

You should see `Mother` was added to the list. If you click on the tree item and lock the document you can add data in the different tabs.

#### Bio
Write a biography or any relevant rich text in the bio tab.

#### Properties 
In this tab you can add plain text or structured data in `hjson`,  `json` `toml`. If the latter this data will be serialized as JSON when generating the game export.

Name, age and gender are automatically created at random when a new actor is detected. 

#### Expressions
A list of images to use when a script using `UAF` calls an expression `[expression]`. In hour example before we added `[happy]` so go ahead and click on `Add Expression` an add a picture for the happy expression.

> Expressions are saved in lower case in the database, thus the matching is case-insensitive.

We can now go and test our script in the player, but , first, take a look at the remaining tabs.

#### Tagged/Speech Scripts

These tabs display all scripts associated with an actor. Tagged scripts will only show lines which contains `[#tag]` tags.  Useful for example, to generate exports for voice actors. 

You will notice that there is a comment before the lines indicating the script id , alias, and node name.

{/* ![Actor tagged scripts](/img/tutorial-actor-tagged-scripts.png) */}

We can navigate to the dialogue or we can use the node name to identify the script in the script section (Remember, the dialogue node contains a linked script)

There is a special read-only folder inside the script section which includes all the dialogue scripts grouped by dialogue. 

{/* ![Actor script player](/img/tutorial-dialogue-script-player.png) */}

This section also contains a script player, but only scoped to the current script. Go ahead an try the new Mother expression.

## Screenplays

While we are here, you can click on `Screenplay` toolbar button, to see/download the current screenplay in a script format. This particular project does not contains much screenplay comments but there is more info [in the docs](/en/docs/documentation/screenplay_generation.html)
