## Scripts

This is one of the main sections of the app. A script is data that you will provide to your game, and it can be written in any language.  
A script could be a standalone document or be part of a dialogue tree. Instead of writing in each dialogue tree node, each node will have its own script attached, but more on that later.  
You will notice two items in the file tree: `goToLibrary` is a really simple script executing a **command** and a special read-only "Dialogues" folder which contains all scripts that are part of a dialogue. Let's ignore that for now.

- Select `goToLibrary` and double-click on the text area. You will notice that `<PlayDialogueByAlias(area)>` and `::Narrator::` are highlighted differently, and that is because they are part of the really small [Drafft Scripting Syntax](scripting.html). Go have a read on that page document for a quick overview. I'll wait...

Also note that this script has an `id` and an `alias` shown in the script editor footer.
