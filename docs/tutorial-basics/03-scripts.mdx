## Scripts

This is one of the main sections of the app, a script is data that you will provide to your game and it can be written in any language.  
A script could be a standalone document or be part of a dialogue tree. Instead of relying on writing int each dialogue tree node, each node will have its own script attached, but more on that later.  
You will notice two items in the file tree: `goToLibrary` is a really simple script executing a **command** and a special read-only "Dialogues" folder which contains all scripts that are part of a dialogue Documents, lets ignore that for now.

- Select `goToLibrary` and double-click on the text area. Press the `Toggle editor hotkeys panel` button. This will open a sidebar on the right with some shortcuts, these will be really useful for repetitive tasks like adding speech actions.
- Modify `ctrl+4` shortcut and add the following: `::Narrator:: % deals % damage.`
- Focus the text area and press `ctrl+4`. Each time a `%` appears in the shortcut it will ask the user for a value. Put `Max` and `66` or whatever you want there.

You will also notice that `<PlayDialogueByAlias(area)>` and `::Narrator::` are highlighted differently and that is because they are part of the really small [Drafft Scripting Syntax](scripting.html). Go have a read on that page document for a quick overview. I'll wait...

Also note that this script has and `id` and an `alias` shown in the script editor footer.
