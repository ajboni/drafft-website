# Can't Delete Old Projects

If you are unable to delete old projects in Drafft, follow the steps below to resolve the issue.

There was a bug in the previous version of Drafft that caused some projects to have a wrong/empty `dbname` value. This caused and issue when trying to load or delete the project.

Although the issue was fixed in the latest version, it is still possible to encounter this problem if you have old projects in your Drafft folder.

## Identify the Problematic Projects

If you notice that in the project manager some projects have a different `Database Name` than the project title, it is very possible that this project might be corrupted and cannot be deleted or loaded properly.

## Example of a Problematic Project

If the project title is "My Project", the database name should be `drafft_2_my_project`. If the `Database Name` show any other value this indicates a mismatch that could lead issues.

## Steps to Fix the Issue

Make sure you have backups of your projects before proceeding with the following steps.

### If the project is not needed and/or can be deleted.

1. Open the project manager and locate the problematic project.
2. Press `ctrl + shift + i` to open the developer tools.
3. Click on the "Application" tab.
4. Go to Storage -> IndexedDB
5. You should see a list of databases. Locate 2 databases with your project title: ex: `_pouch_draft_2_my_project` and `_pouch_draft_2_my_project_mrview-8755123123`.
6. Delete both databases.
7. Restart Drafft.
