# macOS Gatekeeper Warning on First Launch

On macOS, Drafft may be blocked on first launch by **Gatekeeper**. This is expected behavior.

---

## What You May See

macOS may show:

> **“Drafft-2.app” was blocked to protect your Mac.**
> Apple could not verify that this app is free of malware.

On some Intel Macs, an **“Open Anyway”** button appears in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

On **Apple Silicon (M1 / M2 / M3)** systems, this option may **not appear at all**.

---

## Important

- **Drafft is not signed or notarized by Apple**
- macOS is behaving as designed
- The workaround below **bypasses Gatekeeper checks**
- **Proceed at your own risk**

If you are unsure, **do not continue**.

---

## Workaround (Advanced Users Only)

If you trust the source of the app, you can remove the quarantine attribute manually.

```bash
xattr -c ./Drafft-2.app
```

After running this, you should be able to open Drafft normally.
