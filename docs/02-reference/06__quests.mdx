# Quests

Use Quest documents in Drafft to define in-game objectives, side missions, or main storyline beats.

Each Quest doc uses a **dual-pane editor**:

- **Properties**: Define quest metadata, narrative role, rewards, difficulty, etc.
- **Conditions**: Define the game state required to mark the quest as _completed_ (e.g., inventory contains item, dialogue flag is set, boss defeated).

Drafft supports flexible formats: **JSON**, **HJSON**, **TOML**, **YAML**, or plain **text**. Both panes are validated and exported as standard JSON under the hood.
