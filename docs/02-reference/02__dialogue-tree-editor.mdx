# Dialogue Tree Editor

## Overview

Drafft's Dialogue Tree Editor provides a powerful and flexible way to design branching dialogues for games. With a cleaner UI, improved node management, and deep integration with scripts, it allows for intuitive and efficient dialogue creation.

## Features

### Intuitive Design

- A redesigned interface with better node management for a streamlined workflow.
- Support for **Vertical** and **Horizontal** layouts.
- Scripts can be loaded into **sub-tabs** within the dialogue editor.

### Flexible Node System

- Any node can have **multiple input and output ports**.
- Context menu for quick actions: **Edit, Delete, Clone**.
- A **configuration drawer** for managing node attributes (inputs, outputs, title, metadata).

### Script Integration

- Nodes can link to **any script** in the project, whether autogenerated by the dialogue editor or user-created.
- Shared scripts allow for reuse across multiple dialogues or nodes.
- Editing scripts outside the dialogue editor reflects changes instantly.
- To prevent conflicts, scripts must be **locked** before editing.(Future update may include an **"Auto-lock related scripts"** option).
- Adding scripts to dialogue nodes is **optional**.

### Advanced Editing Tools

- **Grid snapping** for precise node alignment.
- **Duplicate nodes** to speed up development.
- **Undo/Redo** support for risk-free experimentation.

### Node Types

- **Jump**: Jump to a specific node.
- **Note**: Add sticky notes for annotations.
- **Script**: Embed scripts directly in dialogues.
- **Choice**: Create branching paths with multiple options.
- **Start**: Define the beginning of a dialogue.
- **End**: Mark the conclusion of a dialogue.
- **Return**: Return to the previous choice point.
- Nodes can also contain **additional notes and metadata**.

## Dialogue Output Schema

The dialogue system generates structured JSON output that represents the entire dialogue tree. Here's an overview of the schema structure:

### Root Properties

- `name`: String - The name of the dialogue
- `type`: String - Usually "Dialogue"
- `parent`: String - ID of the parent element
- `icon`: String - Icon identifier
- `color`: String - Color code in hexadecimal
- `path`: String - Path to the dialogue
- `collection`: String - Collection type, typically "Dialogue"
- Various metadata fields like `created`, `modified`, `locked`, etc.

### Content Structure

The dialogue content is organized in a tree structure under `content.tree` with two main components:

#### Nodes

Each node represents a point in the dialogue flow and includes:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `position`: X and Y coordinates in the editor
- `type`: Node type (typically "base")
- `data`: Contains node-specific information:
  - `label`: Display name (e.g., "1 - Start")
  - `handles`: Connection points for edges
  - `nodeType`: Type of node ("start", "script", "choice", "end", etc.)
  - `scriptId`: Reference to associated script content

#### Edges

Edges define connections between nodes:

- `edgeId`/`id`/`key`: Unique identifier
- `source`/`target`: IDs of connected nodes
- `sourceHandle`/`targetHandle`: IDs of specific connection points
- `points`: Array of coordinate points defining the edge path
- Visual properties like `width`, `color`, `curvyness`
