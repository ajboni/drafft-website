# Why Game Developers Need a Centralized Tool for Managing Game Design Assets

## The Problem: Scattered and Disorganized Game Design Data

Game development involves not just media assets like textures, 3D models, and audio files, but also a vast amount of **game design assets**—scripts, dialogue trees, item databases, game design documents (GDDs), and quest logic. Without a proper system, these assets often become scattered across spreadsheets, notes, or different tools, leading to inefficiencies that slow down production.

### Common Challenges Faced by Developers

1. **Lost or Misplaced Design Data** – Searching for scripts, dialogue trees, or item databases across multiple tools can waste valuable development time.
2. **Version Control Issues** – Without proper tracking, developers risk overwriting critical data or working with outdated information.
3. **Collaboration Hurdles** – Writers, designers, and programmers need a streamlined way to share and update design-related content.
4. **Complexity in Maintaining Coherence** – Keeping all interconnected elements (quests, items, story branches) consistent and well-documented can be overwhelming.

## The Solution: Centralized Game Design Asset Management

A centralized tool for managing game design assets can streamline workflows and eliminate inefficiencies caused by scattered files. Tools like **Drafft** offer a structured environment that ensures all design-related assets are easily accessible, properly versioned, and seamlessly integrated into the development pipeline.

### Benefits of a Centralized System

1. **Single Source of Truth** – All design data is stored in one place, reducing confusion and redundancy.
2. **Improved Collaboration** – Writers, designers, and developers can work together in real-time, ensuring consistency across the game.
3. **Version Control and History** – Track changes, revert to previous iterations, and prevent accidental overwrites.
4. **Optimized Organization** – Categorization, tagging, and search features help developers locate design elements instantly.
5. **Integration with Development Pipelines** – Easily sync structured design data with your game's code or engine.

## How Drafft Simplifies Game Design Asset Management

Drafft is designed specifically for indie game developers who need an efficient and scalable way to manage their **game design assets**. With features such as:

- **Centralized Storage for Scripts and Databases** – Keep all game-related design files in one accessible location.
