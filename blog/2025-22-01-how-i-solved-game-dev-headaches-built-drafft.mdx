*If you’ve ever spent hours battling clunky text editors, lost time waiting for game engine recompiles, or struggled to collaborate on scripts, you’re not alone. As a game developer, I hit a breaking point managing scripts and dialogue trees—until I built Drafft. Here’s why.*

## The Problems That Drove Me Crazy

### 1. Trapped in the Engine: Slow Compilation and Inflexible Scripts
I used to embed scripts and dialogue directly in my game engine (Unity, in my case). It seemed convenient at first, but soon became a nightmare:
- **Slow iteration**: Every script change required a full recompile. Waiting 2-3 minutes just to test a dialogue tweak? No thanks.
- **Brittle workflows**: Scripts compiled into the game binary. Updating content meant rebuilding the entire project. 
- **Zero separation**: Code and content were tangled together. Want to reuse a script? Good luck extracting it.

### 2. Text Editors That Felt Like Stone Age Tools
Game engine text editors are… not great. Mine lacked:
- Syntax highlighting for JSON/scripts
- Search/replace across files
- Autocomplete or error checking

Editing JSON in Unity’s textbox felt like coding with oven mitts on.

## The “Aha” Moment (and the New Problem)

### Taking Content Out of the Engine
I moved scripts and data into external files. **Benefits**:
- Test changes without recompiling the game
- Reuse content across projects
- Version control scripts/dialogue separately
- *Plain text* files! 

**But then**: Managing hundreds of text/JSON files became its own nightmare:

```json
// Example of the JSON chaos:
{
  "dialogue": {
    "scene1": {
      "npc1_line1": "Hello, adventurer!",
      "npc1_line2": "Did you know JSON brackets love to mismatch?"
    }
  }
}
```

- **Tedious formatting**: Missing a comma? Enjoy debugging 500 lines of JSON.
- **No hierarchy**: A folder of 300 JSON files isn’t a “workflow”—it’s a ticking bomb.
- **Zero collaboration**: Git merges for dialogue trees? *Shudder*.

## Why I Built Drafft

### The Final Straw: Expensive Tools for Indie Teams
When I realized I needed a better solution, I looked at tools like **Articy:Draft**. It had some great features, but:
- **Prohibitively expensive**: As an indie team of two, we couldn’t justify the cost.
- **Overkill for our needs**: We didn’t need all the bells and whistles—just a simple, efficient way to manage scripts and data.
- **Subscription required**: Monthly fees added up quickly.
- **Cloud dependency**: Required constant internet access and data storage on their servers.
o
That’s when I decided to build **Drafft**: a tool designed **by indie devs, for indie devs**. Affordable, lightweight, and laser-focused on solving the problems we actually faced.

### 1. Hierarchy Meets Database Power
```Yaml
- Game Design
  - Scripts
    - Chapter1
    - Chapter2
  - Dialogue Trees
    - NPCs
      - Merchant
  - Actors
    - Actor Nam
```
Organize scripts, dialogue, and data in a unified structure. Search, sort, and edit like a database—without losing the familiarity of folders.

### 2.Commom Code Editor Goodies for Game Devs
- **Syntax highlighting**: JSON, scripts, and custom formats.
- **Code folding**: Collapse and expand sections for better readability.
- **Undo/Redo**: Never lose your work with unlimited undo/redo.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with customizable shortcuts.
- **Find and replace**: Quickly make changes across your entire project.

### 3. JSON Export Without the Headaches
- One-click export to game-ready JSON.
- Edit scripts **while the game runs** (no more recompiles!).

### 4. Collaboration That Just Works
- Real-time syncing.
- Work offline and merge changes later.

### 5. Your Data, Your Rules
- **No cloud lock-in**: Data lives on your machine.
- **No subscriptions**: Pay once, own it forever.
