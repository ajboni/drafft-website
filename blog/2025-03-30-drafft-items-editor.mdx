# Introducing the Items Editor: A More Flexible Way to Structure Your Game Data

Game development is a complex process that requires a structured yet flexible approach to data management. Drafft was built to simplify this challenge, helping developers centralize and organize their game data efficiently. Today, we're introducing the **Items Editor**, a powerful new feature that enhances flexibility while maintaining the structured workflow Drafft is known for.

## What Is the Items Editor?

The Items Editor allows you to **dynamically create and manage structured data** using multiple formats:

- **Plain text**
- **JSON**
- **HJSON**
- **TOML**
- **YAML**

This means you can work with **unstructured or semi-structured input** while still ensuring that your data remains usable. When exporting, Drafft will validate and convert the content into JSON, ensuring **consistency and compatibility** with your game project.

## Why This Matters for Game Development

Game data often comes in different formats—whether it's character attributes, level configurations, or dialogue trees. With the Items Editor, you get:

### 🔹 **Data Centralization**

Store all your game-related data in one place, reducing the need for scattered spreadsheets or external documents.

### 🔹 **Organized Workflow**

Use a structured yet flexible approach to managing your game’s metadata, ensuring everything stays clean and accessible.

### 🔹 **Improved Collaboration**

Whether you're a solo developer or part of a team, having a clear and adaptable data structure makes collaboration easier.

### 🔹 **Format Flexibility**

Not sure if JSON is the right format for your current setup? Use YAML, TOML, or HJSON instead—Drafft will handle the conversion when it's time to export.

### 🔹 **Seamless Integration**

By maintaining JSON as the export standard, Drafft ensures your data is **ready for use in your game engine or toolchain** without extra conversion steps.

## How the Items Editor Works

1. **Write your data** using your preferred format in the Items Editor.
2. **Customize your schema** dynamically without predefined restrictions.
3. **Export when ready**, and Drafft will validate, parse, and convert your content into structured JSON.

This gives you **complete control over how your data is structured**, while still ensuring that it's export-ready for development.
