Game development gets messy fast—ideas everywhere, disconnected tasks, and no clear picture of what’s next. That’s why we built **Kanban boards** into Drafft.

Now you can visually plan your game’s features, tasks, or narrative beats—all without leaving your centralized dev space.

### What You Can Do with Drafft’s Kanban:

- ✅ **Create custom boards** per project or document.
- ➕ **Add tasks/cards** with rich descriptions and markdown support.
- 🔗 **Link cards** to characters, items, scenes, or GDD sections.
- 📥 **Drag-and-drop** to move between stages like `TODO`, `Doing`, and `Done`.
- 🎯 **Track development phases** like writing, balancing, or playtesting.

### Why It Matters:

Whether you’re tracking core mechanics, bug fixes, or narrative arcs, Kanban gives you a flexible, visual way to stay focused and avoid scope creep. And because it lives inside Drafft, it’s always connected to your worldbuilding and design docs.

:::tip
Note: Drafft’s Kanban is intentionally simple. It’s not meant to replace full-scale project management tools like Trello, Notion, or Jira. Instead, it gives you just enough structure to stay organized within your game project—without leaving your creative flow.
