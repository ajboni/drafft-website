# Easier Ways to Write Game Dialogue | Scripting Editor, GDD Editor & More

If you’ve ever tried to write dialogue in game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity, then you know how frustrating it can be. Their blueprint and scripting systems work well for basic interactions, and many AAA games have used them. However, things quickly get messy when creating a story-driven or visual novel game. Conversations get crammed into tiny, hard-to-read boxes that make it nearly impossible to track flow, debug efficiently, or make changes without fundamentally breaking something.

As your project and ambition grow, so too does the headache of managing the tangled mess of dialogue. For larger-scale projects, that sometimes means dealing with thousands of lines of text and hundreds of dialogue choices. That’s where Drafft comes in. Drafft is designed specifically with game writers in mind. It streamlines dialogue creation with a non-linear dialogue editor, an advanced scripting system, a powerful GDD (Game Design Document) editor, and more.

Below, we explore how Drafft’s game-changing features make writing, organizing, and implementing dialogue easier.

## Tools That Make Writing Game Dialogue Easier

One major feature that Drafft has to offer is a **Non-Linear Dialogue Tree Editor**. This tool provides a visual tree structure to map out dialogue, letting game developers easily navigate their work. No matter how large your narrative game becomes, the branches stay neat and organized so you don’t have to worry about sorting through a jumbled mess. You can also easily switch to the **Script Editor**, saving precious time as you write the dialogue for NPCs, cutscenes, or player interactions.

The **advanced Script Editor** allows you to generate industry-standard screenplay documents and share them with directors or voice actors. The built-in script player lets you simulate dialogue flow in gameplay, ensuring natural interactions. Meanwhile, smart parsing automatically detects dialogue tags, commands, and emotions, categorizing them for easy organization. It supports multiple languages and converts scripts into JSON.

The **GDD Editor** helps you organize your dialogue, character sheets, and worldbuilding in one place. You can attach images, videos, and audio directly to the document to help refine a character’s personality as you plan their arc. It also lets you create, organize, and share your documents as a PDF or JSON.

## Other Features Drafft Offers

Drafft prioritizes **full data ownership and security**, enabling users to work locally or with their own CouchDB setup—eliminating reliance on the cloud. You can export all your documents and data to JSON or any other format tailored for game engines. With **real-time multi-user collaboration**, teams can sync changes instantly to keep the workflow smooth and efficient.

Drafft also features a **comprehensive repository system** for managing quests, items, and game assets in plain text or in formats like JSON, TOML, and HJSON. Developers can utilize **API access** for automation and tool integration. On top of it all, you don’t have to worry about your platform since Drafft runs on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**.
